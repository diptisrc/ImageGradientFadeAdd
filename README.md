-  Hi, Iâ€™m @diptisrc
-  so this project was originally posted on the Upwork link: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Create-python-script-for-adding-text-borders-image-using-Pillow_~01fe0e375e4211b2fb/
-  and I wanted to apply for this job after creating this script but I was a little late for the application and someone else got the job.
-  add_text function and image are provided by client rest is created by me.
