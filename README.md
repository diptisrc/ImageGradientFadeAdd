    <h1>Code Description</h1>
    <p>This code was created by Diptis Chaudhari. It is a Python script for adding text borders to an image using the Pillow library.</p>
    <p>The code defines a class called "ImageBorderFade" that provides methods for adding borders, applying gradient fade effects, and adding text to an image.</p>
    <p>The "add_border" method adds multiple borders of different sizes and colors to an image.</p>
    <p>The "gradient_fade_bottom" method applies a gradient fade effect to the bottom part of an image.</p>
    <p>The "add_text" method adds text to an image at specific positions using different font styles.</p>
    <p>The "run" method coordinates the entire process by applying the gradient fade effect, adding borders, and adding text to the image.</p>
    <p>To use the code, create an instance of the "ImageBorderFade" class, specify the input and output file names, and call the "run" method.</p>
